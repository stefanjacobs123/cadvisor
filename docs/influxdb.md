#### Exporting cAdvisor Stats to InfluxDB

cAdvisor supports exporting stats to [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com). To use InfluxDB, you need to pass some additional flags to cAdvisor telling it where the InfluxDB instance is located:

**Required**
```
 # storage driver to use. Options are: memory (default) and influxdb
 -storage_driver=influxdb
```
**Optional**
```
 # The *ip:port* of the database. Default is 'localhost:8086'
 -storage_driver_host=ip:port
 # database name. Uses db 'cadvisor' by default
 -storage_driver_db
 # database username. Default is 'root'
 -storage_driver_user
 # database password. Default is 'root'
 -storage_driver_password
 # Use secure connection with database. False by default
 -storage_driver_secure
```
